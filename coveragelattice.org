Given two coverage traces that track , how can we compare them?[fn:1]

This generates a lattice on the coverage traces. One trace can be
strictly greater than another, equal to it, strictly less than it, or
incomparable.

However, when using AFL style tracing, the two traces can differ in
the actual locations[fn:2] visited, or in how many times they visited
each of those locations. Assume that we have a baseline of
coverage. Not all strictly greater traces are equally interesting. If
one trace hits some location more than the baseline, while another
visits an entirely new location, both are improvements, but the second
is intuitively a stronger improvement.

~coveragelattice.dot~ and ~coveragelattice.png~ contain the ordering
of these comparisons. 

The four T/F values represented are[fn:3]:
    1. whether some locations were seen in the first record, but not
       the second
    2. whether some locations were seen more often in the first record
       than in the second
    3. whether some locations were seen less often in the first record
       than in the second
    4. whether some locations were seen in the second record, but not
       the first

So TTFF represents the case where the first record has seen locations
the second hasn't, while FTFF represents merely seeing some branch
more often. 

[fn:1] This is all speculative--I haven't verified that there's any
value in making these distinctions.

[fn:2] A location might be a line, or a the xor'd value representing
the previous location and the current location (as in AFL).

[fn:3] Note that 1 implies 2 and 4 implies 3, so only 9 values are
present in the lattice.
