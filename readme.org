* Coverage

An implementation of the [[https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/technical_details.txt][AFL method of coverage tracking]]. 

Incorporates code from [[https://github.com/quicktheories/QuickTheories][QuickTheories]] for the code necessary to install
an agent that transforms classes and injects tracking code.

** Notes

Because the instrumentation code and coverage tracking code lives in
the same process as the target code, certain packages are excluded
from retransformation and coverage tracking. See CoverageAgent for the
specific packages.
